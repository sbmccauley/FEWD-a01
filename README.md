FEWD Assignment 1

# Hi I'm Sheri!

# and I'm working on my second act...

I spent 27 years in the 60 hours/week work world managing retail stores and restaurants and decided to take a break when I had my son.  Now I'm working on becoming a **Front End Web Developer**.  I feel really lucky to have found something fun and challenging to learn while I'm a stay-at-home mom and hopefully be able to turn it into a new career at some point.

When I'm not doing homework, I like to:
* Spend time with my family and friends
* Read a good mystery 
* Learn to cook different types of food

My latest cooking exploration came about this weekend.  My husband recently returned from Germany from a work trip.  Although it was a work trip, one of the things he most enjoyed in Germany besides the beer, was the schintzel.  If you're not familiar with it, schnitzel is a fried and breaded thinly sliced piece of meat.  Sounds kind of mundane, but a well prepared schnitzel is quite delicious according to my husband, so much so, that he had to recreate it for my so and me upon his return.  It turns out he was correct, and my son and I found it delicious as well, but I decided to put my own spin on it with the leftovers and turned the schnitzel into Japanese Katsudon.  Who would have thought a schnitzel and a katsudon were one in the same???....here's a photo of tonight's dinner.... German schnitzel transformed into Japanese katsudon:
